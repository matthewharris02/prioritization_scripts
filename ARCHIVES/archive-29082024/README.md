This folder contains the older version of the scripts that split it all up into multiple modular scripts and called functions. However, I (MH) decided that considering most of these were only called once, it was not useful and actually made it harder to make adjustments if needed. So I moved them into the main script and moved any of the functions into a helper_functions.R script.
